# Variant Description   
Implement a library for programming in the style ( implement  all processes as finite state machines in one global infinite loop with concurrency.) by using decorators to specify state machine handlers where all  oilerplate code with working with the state was hidden from a programmer. Decorators should support:  
    
	• call the function after a specific delay (like machine 1 in the manual coded example)      
	• simple sequence of states (like machine 2 in the manual coded example)    
	• conduction state transition between, based on a return value
	• work with IO (socket or standard input)
	• work with queue.
